## Description
This has been a personal project of mine to develop my skills using the MERN stack. This has been a great learning experience, from implementing authentication, hashing and salting passwords, building APIs for CRUD functonality, MVC architecture within Express/nodejs, to the frontend; passing props fro parent to child compeoneent, seperating out components to make them reusable. 

## Technologies used
- React
- Express/NodeJs
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- passportJs
- SCSS
- react-bootstrap
- Heroku (for deployment)

## Would have done differently
- Used Typescript, ensure strict used of variables. 
- Used Redux for state management, can become complex when moving between several different states.

## Future functionality
- Add custom tags
- Create enums when adding new meals for fields such as cuisine
- Upload and view images
- Personal recipe inventory, private and public.
